(50–100-word) description of what you did
For our social event we went to Chiptole in UTC after meeting with our client for the first time. We felt like this was an adequate social since the topics we talked about didn’t include anything related to the class. The main point was for us to just get to know each other and hang out outside of where we typically work. We feel like we’ll work well together for the remainder of the project.
